FilmFluent: Subtitle Analysis for Language Learning
FilmFluent is a comprehensive tool I developed to analyze movie subtitles for language learning purposes. By extracting and analyzing word frequencies, sentence structures, and linguistic patterns from subtitle files, FilmFluent helps language learners identify common vocabulary and track their exposure to words across different films.
Problem Solved
Language learners often struggle to bridge the gap between textbook learning and real-world media consumption. FilmFluent solves this by:

Automatically identifying the most frequent words in films to prioritize vocabulary learning
Tracking vocabulary exposure across multiple movies to ensure comprehensive language acquisition
Extracting authentic sentences for contextual learning rather than artificial examples
Creating a personalized database of encountered words to measure progress

Technologies Used

Python: Core application logic and text processing
PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing and querying linguistic data
Natural Language Processing: Custom tokenization and text analysis for word frequency and sentence extraction
RESTful API: For integrating with language learning applications
Data Visualization: Streamlit-based dashboard for visualizing vocabulary statistics

What I Learned
This project significantly enhanced my skills in:

Building efficient data pipelines for text processing
Designing normalized database schemas for linguistic data
Implementing optimization techniques for processing large text corpora
Creating modular, maintainable Python code with appropriate separation of concerns
Error handling and debugging complex data flows
Working with file encodings and international language support

The project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a complete system from data ingestion through analysis to visualization, showcasing both technical skills and practical application development.
